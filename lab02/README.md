### Analysis Questions

1. What depth did you find "best" for the *heart disease* dataset? For the
*diabetes* dataset?
-> For the *heart disease* dataset, I found that depth = 2 is the best
-> For the *diabetes* dataset, I found that depth = 2 is also the best

2. How did you determine that these depth values were the "best"? (i.e. how
  did training and testing accuracy change as the depth changed?)
-> For the training data, the accuracy decreases as the depth decreases
-> For the testing data, the accuracy was increasing until depth 2 was reached then it decreased for larger depths.


3. If doctors were to use these types of
decision trees when diagnosing patients, what issues might arise? Advantages? Disadvantages?
-> One issue that might arise is if a patient is sick but the algorithm predicts he is not.
-> However, if a patient is not sick and the algorithm predicts that he is, then there is no harm because the doctors can run more tests to confirm
-> An advantage to this is that doctors would be able to quickly assess a patient in case of emergency.
